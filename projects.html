        <div class="FirstProjectDescription">
            Probably my first school project. We were tasked to create some shapes in Java.<br/><br/>
            This was when we were first introduced to using for-loops although to be honest, the lessons were a bit rough to understand at first. It became fairly easy when applied to actual programs.<br/><br/>
            Anyways here’s some pictures of the output. I’ll put some links below the picture for you to check out the source code.

        <div class="SecondProjectDescription">
            Second project is about making a calculator.<br/><br/>
            Basically I was messing around when I found that you can create simple GUI using a drag and drop UI within a software called IntelliJ Idea. I created my first GUI with it and thus this spaghetti code was born.<br/><br/>
            Although after I created this I forgot how to do it. I might need to watch a tutorial to replicate what I did.
