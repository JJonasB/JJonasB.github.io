            Hi! My name is Jonas, I mainly create Java Programs. My forte is on the logical side rather than artistic, because of this when creating websites I can only do the bare minimum in HTML but can create a functioning JavaScript alongside the webpage. Don't ask me for CSS ^v^. <br/>
            My discord: jjonasb<br/><br/>
            I am a professional Milk Chugger. <br><br>
            Ps: This website is not responsive. Try zooming out and you'll see it immediately.
            You'll see my spaghetti coding if you view this website's code. Have fun though.<br>
            This was a bad idea.
